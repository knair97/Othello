	Both us worked together on the project. We would discuss how we wanted to
implement the algorithms. Each of us would then write code for different parts 
of the project and then debug the code. We would then upload our code to git 
and test it on one of our computers to determine if it works. 

	We implemented the minimax algorithm to allow our AI to look at possible 
moves that it could make and its opponent could make. This gave it a better idea
of what move is the best move. We attempted to implement the alpha beta 
algorithm to save time but could not get it to work.
